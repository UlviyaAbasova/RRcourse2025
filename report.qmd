#### âœ… **3. Optional Enhancements from Quarto Docs**

I  could try:
- `highlight-style: monokai` for code coloring
- `number-sections: true` for structured output

Update YAML like this:

```yaml
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    toc: true
    toc-location: left
    number-sections: true
    code-fold: true
    code-tools: true
    highlight-style: monokai


## 6. Observations
The show started strong, with Season 2 hitting a peak of **4.64 million** viewers. Over time, there was a gradual decline, and by Season 9, the average episode viewership dropped to around **1.2 million**, a decrease of `3.44 million` from the peak.

## 7. Conclusion
*Suits* gained early traction thanks to its sharp writing and unique legal drama premise. Over time, viewership declined, possibly due to increased competition from streaming platforms or changing storylines.
